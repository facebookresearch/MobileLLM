# MobileLLM

This repository contains the training code of MobileLLM introduced in our work: "[MobileLLM: Optimizing Sub-billion Parameter Language Models for On-Device Use Cases](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14905)", published in ICML 2024.

In this work, we comprehensively consider multiple design factors to obtain high-quality LLMs with fewer than a billion parameters. We integrated (1) SwiGLU activation function, (2) deep and thin architectures, (3) embedding sharing, (4) grouped-query attention to build MobileLLM. MobileLLM-125M/350M attains a remarkable 2.7%/4.3% accuracy boost over preceding 125M/350M SoTA models on zero-shot commonsense reasoning tasks. In our updated version, we further demonstrate that our design philosophy scales effectively to larger models, with SoTA results for MobileLLM-600M/1B/1.5B.

## Run

### Step 1. Requirements:
* python 3.9, pytorch >= 2.0
* pip install -r requirement.txt
   
### Step 2. Data preprocessing
Dividing a tokenized dataset or tokenize your own dataset, and even distribute it across the total number of training nodes, where each node comprises 1x8 GPUs. Next, organize the data into the following structure: 
- basepath
  - 1
    - xxx.jsonl
  - 2
    - xxx.jsonl
  - ...
  - #nodes
    - xxx.jsonl

Each line of a jsonl file is a key-value pair of tokenized data {"token_ids": [1,2,3,4,...]}. 

Our training code is compatible with the data pre-processing method in https://github.com/LLM360/amber-data-prep.


### Step 3. Training script
The script `pretrain.sh` is provided to initiate training on a 1x8 node setup using torchrun. This script can be modified to adjust the `--nnodes` parameter and other settings to suit different multi-node configurations, such as those using slurm or torchx. The learning rate in the script is for 1x8 node with a batch size of 32. If you increase the number of nodes or the batch size, you need to increase the learning rate linearly.

Steps to run:
* In `pretrain.sh` file, specify the  `--train_data_local_path` to the pre-processed data in Step 2 and `--input_model_filename` to `./configs/{model_size}/`.
* Run `bash pretrain.sh `

### Evaluation on Wiki
Download the models and update the checkpoint path in eval.sh
* Run `bash eval.sh `

## Training cost 
It takes the following number of days to train MobileLLM on 1T tokens using 32 NVIDIA A100 80G GPUs.
| 125M | 350M | 600M | 1B | 1.5B | 
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| ~3 days| ~6 days| ~8 days | ~12 days | ~18 days |
